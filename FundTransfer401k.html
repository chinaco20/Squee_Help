								<header><h2>401(k) Fund Transfer</h2></header>
								<p>
									401(k) money poseted in LUMS, both EE and ER, is held in a pending bucket to be funded to individual Prudential Retirement accounts every
									Wednesday. Sometimes Tom will request that an out of cycle transfer be done to close the calendar month. A major warning,
									the LUMS produced suporting docs <b><u>cannot be recreated</u></b> once you are done. If you do not save them they are gone forever. Getting John Graas to undo
									the file build will likely take 2 days.  The timing is funding request on Wedenesday @ 10:00am means ACH Debit on the Friday.
								</p>
								<!--**start EE ERF using Squee**-->
								<h3>Processing a 401(k) Funds Transfer with Squee</h3>
								<p>
									Here are the steps for sending a funding request (transfer file build) to Prudential Retirement.  You must have authorization to send secure
									mail to Payroll Express as well as access the Prudential Sponsor Center website. Also, have your LUMS Helper open as it
									will make certain steps much easier.

															<li><span class="inSquee">Make sure the correct transfer is selected in the transfers list box.</span></li>
														</ol>		
													</li>
												</ul>	
											
											<li><h4>In Squee add ER batches that are ready to transfer.</h4></li>

															in Squee?)
														</span></li>
														<div class="tip"><span class="icon far fa-lightbulb"></span>
															&nbsp;In Squee you are assigning "batches", but in the background Squee is only including
															reports that have not been in a previous Prudential funds transfer <u><i>and</i></u> has a
															LUMS Report Number signifying the report was uploaded to LUMS.
														</div>
													</ol>
												</ul>

											<li><h4>In Squee add EE batches that are ready to transfer</h4></li>
												<ul>
													<li><span class="inSquee">Click on the EE tab.</span></li>
													<li><span class="inSquee">Follow the same steps as adding ER batches.</span></li>

															&nbsp;Really, nothing happening for this step is <em><b>good</b></em>. That's just how LUMS

											<li><h4>In LUMS run the Fund Detail Listing</h4></li>

													<div class="tip"><span class="icon far fa-lightbulb"></span>

														a bad transfer file build.
													</li>
													<li>A .pdf of the report will open. DO NOT CLOSE it, we need to save it later.</li>
													<li>There are three totals on this report that need to go into Squee on the Details tab. These fields in

													<ol>
														<li>The LUMS window should close. That is the good scenario.</li>
														<div class="tip"><span class="icon far fa-lightbulb"></span>
															&nbsp;Another case of LUMS communicating 'nothing' actually means 'perfect'.
														</div>
														<li>
															If a .pdf pops-up, that is <u>bad</u>. That means there is a net debit for the member or members on the
															.pdf report. Net debits or take backs can only be sent as a special request diretly to our Prudential
															service representative and <u>cannot</u> be included in a file build.

													save of the file build. Since these are irreplaceable, this is not being overly cautious. Save the files

													</ol>
												</ul>
											<li><h4>At 10:00 a.m. Send Funding Request by Secure Mail</h4></li>
												<p>Sending the transfer file earlier could very well result in the funding request settling the next day, which does
													not give Tom enough time to do the funds transfer with First Hawaiian Bank. Much later and the ACH debit
													may settle in 3 business days. On the normal cycle that would be a Monday. Issues with closing the month? 
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Go to secure mail.</li>
													<li>In the 'To' line type in "payexp" and LUMS Helper will type out the email.</li>

														<li>Click on the 'Browse' button.</li>
														<li>Navigate to the same folder that the backups were stored.</li>
														<li>Select the file called 767258CC that was created today.</li>
														<li>On the pop-up file explorer click the 'Add' button.</li>
														<li>Once the file is attached (it takes a while, about a minute) click the done button.</li>

													<li>In the To field type "pex", yes another hotstring for payroll.express@prudential.com.</li>
													<li>change to cc address to your email address.</li>
												</ul>
											<li><h4>You will receive 2 email confirmations</h4></li>
												<p>You get two email confirmations. One a few minutes after you send the secure mail. This only confirms that they
													received the email and attachment but it is not confirming the request is good and that the ACH Debit will be
													set up. That comes about 2 hours later if all has gone as planned.
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Email confirmation from payroll express</li>
