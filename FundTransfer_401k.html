								<p>
									Both ER and EE money posted in LUMS for the 401(k) fund are in a pending bucket. The pending money is funded to individual
									member accounts every Wednesday. Sometimes Tom will request an out of cycle transfer be done in order to cleanly close the
									calendar month. The the funding request is sent on Wedenesday @ 10:00am HST triggereing an ACH Debit on the Friday. This timing is
									important for the ACH Debit funding to go smoothly.

								<p>
									<text style="font: italic small-caps bold 12px/30px;"><b><u>A Major Warning</u>:</b></text> the suporting docs that come from LUMS
									<b>cannot be recreated</b> once you are done. If you do not save them they are gone forever (almost). The only way to undo the process
									to fix an error or redo reports is by intervention from John Graas, and could take 2 days.

									Here are the steps for sending a funding request (transfer file build) to Prudential Retirement.  You must have authorization to send secure
